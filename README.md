# SSM - Simple State Machine mixin

SSM is a mixin that adds finite-state machine behavior to a class.

### Installation

    gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
    sudo gem install spoonsix-ssm

### Simple example usage

    class Door
      include SSM

      ssm_initial_state :closed # required
      ssm_state :opened

      ssm_event :open, :from => [:closed], :to => :opened do
        puts "Just opened door"
      end
  
      ssm_event :close, :from => [:opened], :to => :closed do
        puts "Closed door"
      end

    end

    door = Door.new
    door.open
    door.is?(:opened) #=> true
    door.close
    door.is_not?(:opened) #=> true
    door.is?(:closed) #=> true

### Persistence

SSM does not worry about persistence. It does allow the user to specify an instance property to store the State
in, either as a string (default) or as an integer. This can then be persisted. SSM will recover state based on this property.

#### Integrating with Rails and ActiveRecord

In your config/environment.rb file:

    config.gem 'spoonsix-ssm', :lib => 'ssm', :version => '>= 0.1.8', :source => 'http://gems.github.com'
    
Then run:

    rake gems:install
    rake gems:unpack # Optional, if you want to vendor the gem

Add a migration to include the state column, either as a string or integer, for instance:

    create_table :doors do |t|
      t.integer :state # Needed to store the current state as an integer
    end

Setup your ActiveRecord object to use SSM, as

    class Door < ActiveRecord:Base
      include SSM

      ssm_inject_state_into :state, :as_integer => true, :strategy => :active_record

      ssm_initial_state :closed # required
      ssm_state :opened
      ...
    end

    door = Door.new
    door.open
    door.is?(:opened) #=> true
    door.state #=> 1
    door.save

    persisted_door = Door.find(door.id)
    persisted_door.is?(:opened) #=> true
